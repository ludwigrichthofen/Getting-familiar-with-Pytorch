# Getting-familiar-with-Pytorch
By following the pytorch official tutorial and realizing a simple basic proceeding, we can get familiar with the pytorch 

First I translate the official tutorial version-'60 mins blitz' into Chinese and get aliitle familiar with sone basic operations and techniques while using pytorch. I gathered the key codes in a .py file which is in relation to realizing a easy_CNN(lenet,basic ez but classical. 

After these, I will realize a MLP to make a classification on MNIST Dataset.(Why use more complex model?This can somehow be attributed to my future research. My research right now has no connection with CV, and I am not good at utilising DL model with python)
